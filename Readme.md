### Heroku Link
[Gut Buster](https://gut-buster.herokuapp.com)

# To use this repository and deploy the app, you must follow these steps:
1.Set up React
cd ~/environment && git clone https://github.com/senorando/project3-gut-buster && cd project3-gut-buster/
2.	Install your stuff!
a) npm install
b) pip install flask-socketio
c) pip install eventlet
d) npm install -g webpack
e) npm install --save-dev webpack
f) npm install socket.io-client --save
⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ If you see any error messages, make sure you use sudo pip or sudo npm. If it says "pip cannot be found", run which pip and use sudo [path to pip from which pip] install ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️
3.	If you already have psql set up, SKIP THE REST OF THE STEPS AND JUST DO THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:
sudo service postgresql start
4.	Copy your sql.env file into your new directory.
Getting PSQL to work with Python
1.	Update yum: sudo yum update, and enter yes to all prompts
2.	Upgrade pip: sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
3.	Get psycopg2: sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install psycopg2-binary
4.	Get SQLAlchemy: sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1

# Setting up PSQL
1.	Install PostGreSQL: sudo yum install postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-devel postgresql-contrib postgresql-docs
Enter yes to all prompts.
2.	Initialize PSQL database: sudo service postgresql initdb
3.	Start PSQL: sudo service postgresql start
4.	Make a new superuser: sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER
⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ If you get an error saying "could not change directory", that's okay! It worked! ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️
5.	Make a new database: sudo -u postgres createdb $USER
⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ If you get an error saying "could not change directory", that's okay! It worked! ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️
6.	Make sure your user shows up:
a) psql
b) \du look for ec2-user as a user
c) \l look for ec2-user as a database
7.	Make a new user:
a) psql (if you already quit out of psql)
REPLACE THE [VALUES] IN THIS COMMAND! Type this with a new (short) unique password.
b) I recommend 4-5 characters - it doesn't have to be very secure. Remember this password!
create user [some_username_here] superuser password '[some_unique_new_password_here]';
c) \q to quit out of sql
8.	cd into lect11 and make a new file called sql.env and add SQL_USER= and SQL_PASSWORD= in it
9.	Fill in those values with the values you put in 7. b)
Enabling read/write from SQLAlchemy
There's a special file that you need to enable your db admin password to work for:
1.	Open the file in vim: sudo vim /var/lib/pgsql9/data/pg_hba.conf If that doesn't work: sudo vim $(psql -c "show hba_file;" | grep pg_hba.conf)
2.	Replace all values of ident with md5 in Vim: :%s/ident/md5/g
3.	After changing those lines, run sudo service postgresql restart
4.	Ensure that sql.env has the username/password of the superuser you created!
