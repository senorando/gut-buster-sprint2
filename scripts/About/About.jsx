                            Hi, I'm Andy! I came up with the idea of this app because as someone into fitness, 
                            I want to have a good fitness app that has all aspects combined into it, nutrition and exercise.
                            I handled a lot of the backend and frontend of the app and orchestrated the database persistence on the app. 
                            I also created the fitness API/database from scratch since we couldn't find an API online.
                            I've enjoyed making this app despite the difficulties it's had and I'm looking forward to more full stack development in the future!
