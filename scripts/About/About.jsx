                            Hi, I'm Andy! I came up with the idea of this app because as someone into fitness, 
                            I want to have a good fitness app that has all aspects combined into it, nutrition and exercise.
                            I handled a lot of the backend and frontend of the app and orchestrated the database persistence on the app. 
                            I also created the fitness API/database from scratch since we couldn't find an API online.
                            I've enjoyed making this app despite the difficulties it's had and I'm looking forward to more full stack development in the future!

                    A list of the most notable technologies used in this web-app are included at the bottom of this page.<br/><br/>
                    For the backend, the main programming language we used was Python. With Python, we utilized the Flask Micro-Framework 
                    to serve web pages. Along with this, we used socket.io to interface between the front-end and the back-end. Persistence 
                    was achieved using Postgresql and SQLAlchemy to provide an easy interface to interact with the database via Python.<br/><br/>
                    Comments are stored in the database, as well as future user information and preferences. For the front-end, the main technology that 
                    we used was functional React.js, as well as some vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A number of different packages were
                    utilized with React as well, which can be found on the Github page.<br/><br/>
                    Collaboration was utilized using Git and Github. Final deployment of this web app was done on Heroku.

                    Our goal for the users of The Gut Buster is to provide them with the information needed on a daily basis as it pertains to their health and fitness.<br/><br/>
                    Nowadays, a lot of the information people use in their day-to-day lives is spread across a variety of different applications, making it is very difficult
                    to locate the specific information needed from fitness apps.<br/><br/>
                    However, with The Gut Buster, we aim to provide a healthier lifestyle and help our clients achieve their health goals effectively by tracking body measurements
                    and workout patterns.<br/><br/>
                    Gut Buster offers its clients many benefits like helping them monitor their daily diet needs and progress. Gut Buster also provides a tool to improve lifestyle habits
                    through constant reminders about health goals, thus keeping clients motivated.
